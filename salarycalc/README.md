THEN CALCULATE THE FOLLOWING --
DA, HRA, CCA, TOTAL SALARY ETC
1) If basic_sal  >  10,000 &&  basic_sal < = 15,000
   then DA=85% of basic 
   CCA = 1% of basic
   HRA = 10% of basic
2) If basic_sal > = 15,000 && basic_sal < 20,000
   DA = 110% basic_sal, HRA = 15% of basic_sal, CCA = 1.5% of basic_sal
   also your Net_sal = BASIC + DA + HRA + CCA
             Grand_sal = Net_sa; - Deduction
